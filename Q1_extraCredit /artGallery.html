The Art Gallery I decided to make is called Paris Gallery. What this gallery is all about is art pieces specifically dedicated to the history of Paris and Paris only. 
The Only way to view this Gallery is here in Lyon, Paris.
The History behind this gallery is that Paris needed a way to hold onto to memories created amongst its community so this gallery was created.
The type of art show cased is abstract-like artwork.
