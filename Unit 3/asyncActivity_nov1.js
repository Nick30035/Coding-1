// Strings
// Var variables can be updated and re-declared, let variables can be updated but not re-declared and const variables can't be updated nor re-declared.

console.log(200*10*2)

// We use the let variable in a scenario that we know the value of the variable will change.
// We use const variable in a scenario that we know the value of the variable can't be changed.

// More of a serious working enviornment could help
// Maybe some more one-on-one attention could also help us in our learning experience
// More practice when it comes to coding
