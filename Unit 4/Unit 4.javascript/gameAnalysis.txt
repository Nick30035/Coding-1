// The game elements from the video I watched are similar to that of the Dino game
// Jump, run, hit SPACE

//  The player interacts with the game by being able to play on a Laptop,
// and can have a character run forward, while simultaneously jumping over obstacles using
// the SPACE bar

// The game animations / visuals represents 2d


// The player is trying to avoid random obstacles by jumping over them, thus receiving points
// and seeing how long they can go without messing up

// I would say what makes this game unique and different from the Dino game
// but still having the same concept is the artwork, as well as the attention to detail
