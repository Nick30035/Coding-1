// The name of my game will be Golf & Chill

//  My game will fall under the genre of sports

// The general game idea/loop is for players to score a certain amount of points within a number
// of rounds and get the most distance out of their swing

// Inspiration taken from other golf games would be Gold Clash, a mobile game. 
// Examples from Golf Clash I'm taking inspiration from would be the meter they have, 
// as well as the different angles you can take. Also how far you can hit the ball

// My game will allow the player to move their camera vertically and horizontally
// to aim and hit the game
// My game will feauture different golf clubs with different amount of power
