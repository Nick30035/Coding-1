// Numerical Operator

// A part that doesn't make sense to me is when they ask you to pass a new grade and avergae out the
// grade 

// The program is asking you to get a grade passed based off the number

// Input data provided is the number 80,the data asks for a number to be passed in
// The desired output is a number, it wants a letter back from the number in return

// Using pseudo, I would start by making a function then calculate, if else, console.log and var


2. // The problem is asking us to make a rock, paper, scissors progam that will give us three different
// options telling us who won, loss or who drawed

// The problem makes sense

// Key words is Loop

// Input data provided is rock, papers, and scissors, it says the program needs to take in a loop
// also

// Output desired is who won, loss, or drawed, 3/3 turns and 

//
